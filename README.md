# ClojureNauts Code of Conduct

All participants within our ClojureNauts organisation are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organisation owners will enforce this code throughout the organisation. We are expecting cooperation from all participants to help ensuring a safe environment for everybody.

**tl;dr: Be excellent with each other**

## The Quick Version

Our ClojureNauts is dedicated to providing a harassment-free learning experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion (or lack thereof). We do not tolerate harassment of ClojureNauts participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any ClojureNauts entity, including repository, issue, wiki, pull-request, comments and others. ClojureNauts participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the ClojureNauts organisation at the discretion of the ClojureNauts organisers.

## The Less Quick Version

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of repositories, issues, wikis, pull-request, comments or other entities, inappropriate contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the ClojureNauts organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the ClojureNauts organisation with no refund.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of ClojureNauts staff immediately.

ClojureNauts staff will be happy to help participants contact local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe in the ClojureNauts organisation. We value your contributions.

We expect participants to follow these rules at ClojureNauts and workshop venues and ClojureNauts-related social events.
